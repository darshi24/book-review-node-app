# book-review-node-app
Back-end codebase of a book review website that allows users to search, post reviews, follow and unfollow reviewers and add books to a wishlist.

Visit the repo [book-review-react-app](https://github.com/darshi24/book-review-react-app) for information about the website and how to use it.
Or visit the [Book Reviews website](https://preeminent-cranachan-3c8ddf.netlify.app/) deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to experience just how intuitive the design is yourself.
